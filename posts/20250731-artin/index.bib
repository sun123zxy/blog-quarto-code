	title = {Introduction To Commutative Algebra},
	abstract = {This book grew out of a course of lectures given to third year undergraduates at Oxford University and it has the modest aim of producing a rapid introduction to the subject. It is designed to be read by students who have had a first elementary course in general algebra. On the other hand, it is not intended as a substitute for the more voluminous tracts such as Zariski-Samuel or Bourbaki. We have concentrated on certain central topics, and large areas, such as field theory, are not touched. In content we cover rather more ground than Northcott and our treatment is substantially different in that, following the modern trend, we put more emphasis on modules and localization.},

	title = {A term of Commutative Algebra},
	abstract = {There is no shortage of books on Commutative Algebra, but the present book is different. Most books are monographs, with extensive coverage. But there is one notable exception: Atiyah and Macdonald's 1969 classic. It is a clear, concise, and efficient textbook, aimed at beginners, with a good selection of topics and exercises. So it has remained popular. However, its age and flaws do show, including many unsolved exercises.
So there is need for an updated and improved version, which includes
solutions to all their exercises and to many more. The present book aims to be that version.},
