A particular transform is proposed that is defined on a finite ring of integers with arithmetic carried out modulo Fermat numbers. This Fermat number transform (FNT) is ideally suited to digital computation, requiring on the order ofN {\textbackslash}log Nadditions, subtractions and bit shifts, but no multiplications. In addition to being efficient, the Fermat number transform implementation of convolution is exact, i.e., there is no roundoff error. There is a restriction on sequence length imposed by word length but multi-dimensional techniques are discussed which overcome this limitation. Results of an implementation on the IBM 370/155 are presented and compared with the fast Fourier transform (FFT) showing a substantial improvement in efficiency and accuracy.},

All bounds on ω since 1986 have been obtained using the so-called laser method, a way to lower-bound the ‘value’ of a tensor in designing matrix multiplication algorithms. The main result of this paper is a refinement of the laser method that improves the resulting value bound for most sufficiently large tensors. Thus, even before computing any specific values, it is clear that we achieve an improved bound on ω, and we indeed obtain the best bound on ω to date:ω {\textless} 2.37286.The improvement is of the same magnitude as the improvement that [Le Gall'14] obtained over the previous bound [Vassilevska W.'12]. Our improvement to the laser method is quite general, and we believe it will have further applications in arithmetic complexity.},

	abstract = {Transforms using number theoretic concepts are developed as a method for fast and error-free calculation of finite digital convolution. The transforms are defined on finite fields and rings of integers with arithmetic carried out modulo an integer and it is shown that under certain conditions this gives the same results as conventional digital convolution. Because of these characteristics they are ideally suited to digital computation by taking into account quantization of amplitude as well as time in their definition. When the modulus is chosen as a Fermat number a transform results that requires only on the order of N log N additions and word shifts but no multiplications. In addition to being efficient, they have no roundoff error and do not require storage of basis functions. There is a restriction on sequence length imposed by word length and a problem with overflow but methods for overcoming these are presented. Results of an implementation on an IBM 370/155 are presented and compared with the fast Fourier transform showing a substantial improvement in efficiency and accuracy. Variations on the basic number theoretic transforms are also presented.},

	abstract = {A lattice is a partially ordered set supporting a meet (join) operation that returns the largest lower bound (smallest upper bound) of two elements. Just like graphs, lattices are a fundamental structure that occurs across domains including social data analysis, natural language processing, computational chemistry and biology, and database theory. In this paper we introduce discrete-lattice signal processing (DLSP), an SP framework for data, or signals, indexed by such lattices. We use the meet (or join) to define a shift operation and derive associated notions of filtering, Fourier basis and transform, and frequency response. We show that the spectrum of a lattice signal inherits the lattice structure of the signal domain and derive a sampling theorem. Finally, we show two prototypical applications: spectral analysis of formal concept lattices in social science and sampling and Wiener filtering on multiset lattices in combinatorial auctions. Formal concept lattices are a representation of relations between objects and attributes. Since relations are equivalent to bipartite graphs and hypergraphs, DLSP offers a form of Fourier analysis for these structures.},
