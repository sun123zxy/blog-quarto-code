Ex-OI/XCPCer, major in mathematics currently. Intrest ranges from mathematics (algebra mainly) to computer science (TCS / web / proof assistant mainly). In my spare time, I enjoy learning anything that occurred to my mind. In weekends one might catch me wandering around Wikipedia, writting blogs, exploring publishing systems (Quarto, LaTeX, etc.) or creating handy codes for myself. When I really want to relax, I play independent games and enjoy their OST.

A more casual introduction can be found [here (zh)](/posts/about). 

This site is powered by [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a publishing system that I find most suitable for my needs. It's designed for those who write in Markdown and present in other formats, a unified way to create blog posts, papers and presentations. See my configuration at [SunQuarTeX](https://github.com/sun123zxy/sunquartex), a Quarto template for scholarly writing in both Chinese and English.

The avatar is drawn by myself with Photoshop when I was a kid. Nothing special beside that, though :)
